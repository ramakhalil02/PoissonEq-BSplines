# B-spline Collocation Method for Solving Poisson's Equation

This project is from independent research and development conducted during my **Master of Science program in Computational Physics**. The entire methodology, analysis, and implementation of all numerical solvers were executed solely by me, and the full work is documented in the accompanying report and code.

## About The Project

This work uses the **B-spline Collocation Method** to solve **Poisson's Equation** for systems exhibiting spherical symmetry. The primary goal is to determine the electrostatic potential $V(r)$ arising from different one-dimensional charge distributions in both classical and quantum contexts.

The numerical solution is applied and validated against analytical solutions for three benchmark cases: a Uniformly Charged Sphere, a Uniformly Charged Shell, and the electron charge density of the Hydrogen atom in its ground state.

## Core Objectives

1.  **Implement B-spline Collocation:** Develop a numerical scheme based on B-splines to discretize and solve the second-order Poisson's equation.
2.  **Solve Classical Problems:** Calculate the potential $V(r)$ for standard classical distributions (Sphere and Shell) and analyze the numerical handling of derivative discontinuities.
3.  **Solve Quantum Problems:** Apply the method to a quantum system by finding the potential generated by the Hydrogen ground state electron density.
4.  **Validate Accuracy:** Compare the numerical potentials against the known analytical solutions across all three benchmark problems.

## Methods Implemented

The computational core of the project implements the following techniques:

| Method | Role in Project | Key Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **B-spline Collocation** | Core numerical solver. | Uses a basis set of B-splines to approximate the solution $V(r)$, transforming the differential equation into a solvable system of linear equations. |
| **Spherical Poisson's Eq.** | Governing equation. | Solved using the specific form $\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2 \frac{dV}{dr}\right) = -4\pi\rho(r)$. |
| **Charge Distributions** | Benchmark test cases. | Includes: uniform sphere, uniform shell (handling discontinuities), and the exponentially decaying density of the Hydrogen atom. |

## Key Findings

* **Excellent Agreement:** The numerical potential $V(r)$ showed excellent agreement with the analytical solutions for all tested charge distributions.
* **Discontinuity Capture:** The B-spline collocation method proved highly effective in accurately capturing the sharp changes (discontinuities in the derivative) at the boundaries of the uniformly charged shell.
* **Quantum Accuracy:** For the Hydrogen atom's electron density, the numerical and analytical potential curves overlapped almost perfectly, accurately modeling the Coulomb potential's exponential decay.
* **Method Efficacy:** The B-spline collocation method is confirmed as a robust and effective tool for solving Poisson's equation in spherical symmetry for both classical electrostatics and quantum mechanical charge densities.
